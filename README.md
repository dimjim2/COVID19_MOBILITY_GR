Deployment of ML models for forecasting Greek citizens' mobility and pandemic indicators during COVID19 crisis.

This repository contains the data, code, presentation and report of my diploma thesis for my BSc at University of Pireaus, Greece, supervised by Professor Yannis Theodoridis.
## Overview
The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the biggest challenges faced by modern societies as it extremely affected every aspect of human life. In the absence of prior knowledge about the virus and its effects, governments took unprecedented measures to restrict human mobility in order to hinder its spread in the general population and to secure health care systems.

Focusing on the geographical area of ​​Greece, the goal of this diploma thesis is to conduct bibliography research regarding the impact of COVID-19 on human mobility and urban transport modes, as well as the development of machine learning models (MLP, RNN, LSTM, Random, Forests, SVR, XGBoost,CNN, CNN-LSTM, GRU) using Tensorflow and Keras to predict the citizens' mobility indexes derived from Google and Apple datasets and important pandemic indicators that represent the epidemiological advancement of COVID19 in Greek society (eg, number of deaths, cases) through real scenarios.
